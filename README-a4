file system construction tool for the Williams [redacted] File System.

  README-a4 - this file
  Makefile - make system rules; builds mkfs.wufs by default
  mkfs.wufs.c - code for building version 0xEEEF of wufs
  wufs_fs.h - general parameters describing wufs layout
  wufs.c - bitmap code
  wufs.h - interface for wufs.c bitmap code, above
  a4.img - my 1024-block image file
  a4.od - an octal dump of a4.img

changes:
  doubled dirent size to 32-byte; allows 30-char filenames
  last block pointer in inode struct is now indirect
    8 direct block pointers
    1 indirect pointer, if needed. 
    allocates full block of __u16 -> 512 extra blocks
  changed defines in wufs_fs.h
    WUFS_INODE_DIRECT - number of direct pointers per inode
    WUFS_INODE_INDIRECT - number of indirect pointers per inode
    WUFS_INODE_BPTR - number of pointers per inode (9)
    WUFS_INODE_PTR_CT - number of blocks per inode (520)
    WUFS_BPTRS_PER_BLOCK - number of block pointers per block
  rewrote bad block file allocation
    only one file '.badblockfilexactlythirtychars' allocated now 
    fs generation crashes if there are more than 520 bad blocks
  changed wufs magic number to 0xEEEF
  max filesize is now in terms of blocks, not bytes
    changed in mkfs.wufs.c when calculating for superblock entry
      size is simply WUFS_INODE_PTR_CT
    documentation updated in wufs_fs.h
